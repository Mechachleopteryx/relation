@title{Algebraic Operators}

@defmodule[relation/algebraic]

Generic algebraic operators for composing data.

The built-in operators @racket[+] and @racket[*] operate on numbers specifically. Often, however, we are interested in performing operations "similar" to these for datatypes that aren't numbers, for which we would resort to type-specific operators like @racketlink[b:append "append"] for lists.

This module generalizes the standard algebraic operators to work on any type that supports a "canonical" notion of addition, multiplication, or concatenation. This allows our intuitions about addition and other forms of composition to extend over all appropriate types via the use of the common generic operators @racket[+], @racket[*] and @racket[..].

@(define eval-for-docs
  (parameterize ([sandbox-output 'string]
                 [sandbox-error-output 'string]
                 [sandbox-memory-limit #f])
                 (make-evaluator 'racket/base
                                 '(require relation)
                                 '(require racket/set)
                                 '(require racket/stream))))

@section[#:tag "algebraic:interfaces"]{Interfaces}

This module provides three generic interfaces -- @racket[gen:appendable], @racket[gen:multipliable], and @racket[gen:addable]. These are meant to represent the canonical "idea" of the operations of concatenation, multiplication and addition, respectively, whose behavior may be customized for each type via these generic interfaces, and used via the common operators @racket[..] (concatenation), @racket[*] (multiplication), and @racket[+] (addition).

In order to support generic composition seamlessly, all of the composition interfaces support a generic (rather than type- and operation-specific) @hyperlink["https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identity_element"]{identity} value that is employed in cases where type information is not available.

@defthing[ID composition-identity?]{
 The special value @racket[ID] serves as the generic identity value for all composition operations when the type of the operands is not known. It may appear at intermediate stages of a computation when there isn't sufficient information to infer a type-specific identity. Any value when composed with @racket[ID] yields itself.

@examples[
    #:eval eval-for-docs
    (+ 5 ID)
    (* ID 5)
    (+)
    (apply * '())
  ]
}

In the event no operands are received in the course of a computation, the result of composition would be @racket[ID], which would not be a usable result in utilities that are expecting a specific type such as a string. In such cases, the result could be converted to the expected type using one of the transformers in @seclink["Type_Transformers" #:doc '(lib "relation/scribblings/relation.scrbl")]{relation/transform} such as @racket[->string]. If you are not using a built-in type but rather a @seclink["define-struct" #:doc '(lib "scribblings/guide/guide.scrbl")]{custom type}, however, you could use the following more general utility to "reify" the generic identity value to a type of your choosing:

@defproc[(reify [v any/c] [example any/c])
         any/c]{

 "Reifies" a value to a specific type. If the value is already a tangible value (i.e. anything other than @racket[ID]), then it is returned without modification. Otherwise, the appropriate nullary value for the type is returned. The nullary value is defined as the identity value for the @racket[append] operation for the type, so custom types are expected to implement the @racket[gen:appendable] interface in order to leverage this utility.

@examples[
    #:eval eval-for-docs
    (reify ID 3)
    (reify ID "cherry")
    (reify ID (list))
    (reify "hi" (list))
    (reify '(1 2 3) "")
  ]
}

@subsection{Concatenation}

@defthing[gen:appendable any/c]{

 A @tech/reference{generic interface} that represents any object for which a concatenation or "append-like" operation can be defined. The following built-in types have implementations for @racket[gen:appendable]:

@itemlist[
 @item{@tech/reference{numbers}}
 @item{@tech/reference{strings}}
 @item{@tech/reference{byte strings}}
 @item{@tech/reference{lists}}
 @item{@tech/reference{vectors}}
 @item{@tech/reference{sets}}
 @item{@tech/reference{sequences}}
 @item{@seclink["procedures" "procedures" #:doc '(lib "scribblings/reference/reference.scrbl")]}
]

@examples[
    #:eval eval-for-docs
    (.. "hi" " " "there")
    (.. '(1 2 3) '(4 5 6))
  ]

@defproc[(appendable? [v any/c])
         boolean?]{

 Predicate to check if a value may be operated on using the generic append operator, @racket[..] or @racket[âˆ˜].

@examples[
    #:eval eval-for-docs
    (appendable? 3)
    (appendable? #\a)
    (appendable? "cherry")
    (appendable? (list))
    (appendable? (set))
    (appendable? (hash))
    (appendable? (vector))
  ]
}

 To implement this interface for custom types, the following methods need to be implemented:

 @defproc[(append [a appendable?]
                  [b appendable?])
          appendable?]{

 A function taking two arguments that composes them in the natural "append-like" operation for the type. Both arguments are expected to be instances of the structure type to which the generic interface is associated (or a subtype of the structure type).

 In addition to providing a definition of concatenation appropriate to the type, implementations of this method must also handle the special value @racket[ID] in the following way: if the operand @racket[b] is @racket[eq?] to @racket[ID], then the result of the function must be @racket[a].
 }

 @defproc[(appendable-identity [a appendable?])
          appendable?]{

 A function that returns the identity value for the type, for the @racket[append] operation. The identity value is that value which, when composed with other values of the same type under the @racket[append] operation, yield those other values as if there had been no composition. The identity value is expected to be an instance of the structure type to which the generic interface is associated (or a subtype of the structure type).
 }

 @defproc[(appendable-inverse [a appendable?])
          appendable?]{

 A function that returns the inverse value for the type, for the @racket[append] operation. The inverse value is that value which, when composed with other values of the same type under the @racket[append] operation, yields the identity value. The inverse value is expected to be an instance of the structure type to which the generic interface is associated (or a subtype of the structure type).

 Providing an implementation for this method is optional, and most types would usually not define an inverse for an append-like operation. That is, in mathematical terms, append-like operations typically form an algebraic @hyperlink["https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semigroup"]{semigroup} or @hyperlink["https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monoid"]{monoid} rather than a @hyperlink["https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_(mathematics)"]{group}.
 }

}

@subsection{Multiplication}

@defthing[gen:multipliable any/c]{

 A @tech/reference{generic interface} that represents any object for which a "multiplication-like" operation can be defined. The following built-in types have implementations for @racket[gen:multipliable]:

@itemlist[
 @item{@tech/reference{numbers}}
]

 Since numbers are the only common type for which the @racket[multiply] operation is defined, this interface is present mostly for uniformity, being leveraged by utilities like @racket[fold], and of course also for use in custom types.

@examples[
    #:eval eval-for-docs
    (* 1 2 3 4)
  ]

@defproc[(multipliable? [v any/c])
         boolean?]{

 Predicate to check if a value may be operated on using the generic multiplication operator, @racket[*].

@examples[
    #:eval eval-for-docs
    (multipliable? 3)
    (multipliable? #\a)
    (multipliable? "cherry")
    (multipliable? (list))
  ]
}

 To implement this interface for custom types, the following methods need to be implemented:

 @defproc[(multiply [a multipliable?]
                    [b multipliable?])
          multipliable?]{

 A function taking two arguments that composes them in the natural "multiplication-like" operation for the type. Both arguments are expected to be instances of the structure type to which the generic interface is associated (or a subtype of the structure type).

 In addition to providing a definition of multiplication appropriate to the type, implementations of this method must also handle the special value @racket[ID] in the following way: if the operand @racket[b] is @racket[eq?] to @racket[ID], then the result of the function must be @racket[a].
 }

 @defproc[(multipliable-identity [a multipliable?])
          multipliable?]{

 A function that returns the identity value for the type, for the @racket[multiply] operation. The identity value is that value which, when composed with other values of the same type under the @racket[multiply] operation, yield those other values as if there had been no composition. The identity value is expected to be an instance of the structure type to which the generic interface is associated (or a subtype of the structure type).
 }

 @defproc[(multipliable-inverse [a multipliable?])
          multipliable?]{

 A function that returns the inverse value for the type, for the @racket[multiply] operation. The inverse value is that value which, when composed with other values of the same type under the @racket[multiply] operation, yields the identity value. The inverse value is expected to be an instance of the structure type to which the generic interface is associated (or a subtype of the structure type).

 Providing an implementation for this method is optional; a @racket[multiply] operation need not admit an inverse, for instance, for a custom integer type, multiplication would not define an inverse since multiplicative inverses for numbers would be rational numbers, rather than integers, thus being excluded by the "same type" requirement above.
 }

}

@subsection{Addition}

@defthing[gen:addable any/c]{

 A @tech/reference{generic interface} that represents any object for which an "addition-like" (group) operation can be defined. The following built-in types have implementations for @racket[gen:addable]:

@itemlist[
 @item{@tech/reference{numbers}}
 @item{@tech/reference{vectors}}]

@examples[
    #:eval eval-for-docs
    (+ 1 2 3)
    (+ #(1 2 3) #(1 2 3) #(1 2 3))
  ]

@defproc[(addable? [v any/c])
         boolean?]{

 Predicate to check if a value may be operated on using the generic addition operator, @racket[+].

@examples[
    #:eval eval-for-docs
    (addable? 3)
    (addable? #\a)
    (addable? "cherry")
    (addable? (list))
    (addable? (set))
    (addable? (hash))
    (addable? (vector))
  ]
}

 To implement this interface for custom types, the following methods need to be implemented:

 @defproc[(add [a addable?]
               [b addable?])
          addable?]{

 A function taking two arguments that composes them in the natural "addition-like" operation for the type. Both arguments are expected to be instances of the structure type to which the generic interface is associated (or a subtype of the structure type).

 In addition to providing a definition of addition appropriate to the type, implementations of this method must also handle the special value @racket[ID] in the following way: if the operand @racket[b] is @racket[eq?] to @racket[ID], then the result of the function must be @racket[a].
 }

 @defproc[(addable-identity [a addable?])
          addable?]{

 A function that returns the identity value for the type, for the @racket[add] operation. The identity value is that value which, when composed with other values of the same type under the @racket[add] operation, yield those other values as if there had been no composition. The identity value is expected to be an instance of the structure type to which the generic interface is associated (or a subtype of the structure type).
 }

 @defproc[(addable-inverse [a addable?])
          addable?]{

 A function that returns the inverse value for the type, for the @racket[add] operation. The inverse value is that value which, when composed with other values of the same type under the @racket[add] operation, yields the identity value. The inverse value is expected to be an instance of the structure type to which the generic interface is associated (or a subtype of the structure type).

 Providing an implementation for this method is required; an addition operation must admit an inverse. That is, in mathematical terms, addition-like operations are expected to form an algebraic @hyperlink["https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_(mathematics)"]{group}.

 Similar to @racketlink[f:foldl "foldl"] and @racketlink[f:foldr "foldr"], but infers the relevant @racketlink[id "identity"] element and uses it as the base value, if none is provided. The identity element is determined by considering the first element of the input sequence together with the given operation.

 With folding operations there are two parameters that one may wish to tweak. The first is the direction of the fold, either left or right, for which one may use either @racket[foldl] or @racket[foldr]. The second is the order in which arguments are supplied to the folding function @racket[f], which may be controlled by the keyword argument @racket[#:order], with a value of @racket['abb] corresponding to the accumulator always being passed second, consistent with Racket's built-in @racketlink[f:foldl "foldl"], and a value of @racket['bab] corresponding to the accumulator always being passed first, consistent with the version of @racketlink[d:foldl "foldl"] found in @racket[data/collection] and also in some other functional languages like Haskell.

 In many common cases, modulating the folding direction and/or the argument order does not make a difference to the result. Specifically, in those cases where the operation is @hyperlink["https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commutative_property"]{commutative} and @hyperlink["https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closure_(mathematics)"]{closed}, it doesn't matter whether you use @racket[foldl] or @racket[foldr], or whether you use argument order @racket['abb] or @racket['bab]. The result would be the same. However, in cases where the operation is not closed, argument order becomes significant. As a general guideline, choose between @racket[foldl] and @racket[foldr] in cases where the operation is not commutative (a relatively common case, such as string concatenation), and between the two argument orders in cases where the operation isn't closed (a less common case, such as type constructors).

 @racket[foldl] is equivalent to calling @racket[fold] with @racket[#:direction 'left], and @racket[foldr] is equivalent to calling @racket[fold] with @racket[#:direction 'right]. @racket[fold/steps] is equivalent to calling @racket[fold] with @racket[#:with-steps? #t].
